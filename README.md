# McDicMapScripter
Make your code to make the advanced map easily!

# What is McDicMapScripter?
McDicMapScripter(= MDMS) is the compiler which translates McDicLanguage into Minecraft commands(mcfunction files). It's for Minecraft map making.

# How can I use it?
You can download the source code and use the program. Online editor is not available yet.

# Features
- "Event" based language structure
  - In this language, Event is very important concept. It's same as function in other programming language. (I named "Event" to avoid confuse with Minecraft command /function)
- Int/Float/Bool variables
  - You can define the variables for calculation. And also array supported.
- Basic operation for variables
  - Basic arithmetic and logic operations are available.
- If/Elif/Else branching and While Looping
  - Branching and Looping makes you make the map control flow very easily.
- Real time delay
  - You can delay the time by just writing 1 line of code.
- Recursive Event calling
  - Recursive calling makes your map logic stronger.
- MultiProcess Event calling
  - You can do the multiple operation at the same time. 
- Smooth cinematic cutscene for Minecraft
  Cutscene is very important in Minecraft map. MDMS generates smooth curve for cutscene with points you set up.

# Future Plans
- Smooth armorstand animations for Minecraft
- Advanced mathematic functions(log, sin, etc)
